# dj 2.0.0

# Motivation

"dj takes the cacaphony of java, git, clojure, clojurescript and build
tools and mixes it into something harmonious."

In a nutshell, dj is an attempt to make a clojure distribution. To be
more accessible, dj now uses leiningen as a base for creating a
distribution.

Lots of changes in the new branch, more to come.
