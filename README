# Description

dj takes the cacaphony of java, git, clojure, and build tools and
mixes it into something a bit more harmonious

# Features

-manage system dependencies, native dependencies, live sources, and jars

# File Directory Structure

-The design of the directory hierarchy is based of the design of unix's
 specifically, gentoo's

bin/
 -dj binaries and scripts to manage system
src/
 -source code for dj
lib/
 -used by leiningen

-the remaining directories are ignored by git (listed in .gitignore)

usr/
 -local (non-system) content
usr/src
 -repository for live projects
usr/bin
 -native dep binaries
etc/
 -system configuration files
sbin/
 -this directory is required only if the local system does not provide
  the dependencies
 -contains system dependency binaries, binaries necessary to run clojure
  and dj this is designed to be minimal
 -pretty much its only java and git
opt/
 -location of system and native dependencies that need to persist
 -basically the install directory for java
tmp/
 -contains transient files
tmp/dj
 -workspace for building system and native dependencies
